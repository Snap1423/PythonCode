## Learning Objectives:
By working through these programs, students will learn:
- How to handle user input and validate data
- Working with different data types (int, float, string, boolean)
- Using arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
- Type casting and conversion between data types
- String manipulation and pattern checking
- Formatted output for professional presentation
- Basic error handling and input validation

## How to Run:
```bash
python 01_student_grade_calculator.py
python 02_shopping_bill_calculator.py
